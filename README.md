## Purpose of the App
The **BudgetApp** is designed to help users manage their finances efficiently by tracking expenses, setting budgets, and visualizing spending patterns. Aimed at individuals seeking better financial control, it provides tools to categorize expenses, monitor cash flow, and make informed financial decisions.

## Design Considerations
The app was developed with a focus on easy readablity, performance, and scalability. Key design decisions include:

- **Architecture**: The app utilizes **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase modular and maintainable.
- **Libraries and Dependencies**:
  - **Retrofit** for networking
  - **OkHttp** for HTTP operations
  - **Filament** for advanced graphics rendering  
  This combination offers a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Dependency Management**:
  - **AGP (Android Gradle Plugin)**: 8.4.0
  - **Kotlin**: 1.9.0  
  Core libraries like `coreKtx`, `lifecycleRuntimeKtx`, and `activityCompose` are at their latest stable versions, ensuring compatibility and security.
- **UI Framework**: The app leverages **Jetpack Compose** for modern, declarative UI creation, providing a smooth and interactive experience for users.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions Usage
The project utilizes **GitHub** for version control, allowing collaborative development and tracking of changes. **GitHub Actions** are set up to automate tasks such as:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Builds and tests are automatically triggered on each commit to ensure that the codebase remains stable and that no new changes introduce bugs.
- **Deployment Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflows are configured to deploy the latest version of the app to relevant environments, streamlining the deployment process.

This setup improves efficiency and ensures a consistent, high-quality codebase.
